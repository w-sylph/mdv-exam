# Introduction
- This exam aims to test your scalability skills as well as your critical thinking skills
- This is to test how much can you forsee as possible enhancements that will be requested by the clients
- This is a part by part exam, I highly suggest to NOT read all the `sprints` read them incrementally one by one
- Separate each branch for each sprint for easier checking on how you improved your code

# Notes
- You may use the laravel boilerplate if you want, but if you really want to test your skills you may use the standard laravel installed via composer
- You may also use vue or just plain HTML inputs
- You may message me or setup as discord call if you have questions
